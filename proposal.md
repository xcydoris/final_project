## The tentative project title

NYC HIV Testing and Diagnosis

## The motivation for this project

As the STD rates recently reach the highest in the US, we would like to
know more about how to effectively address the issue. An HIV infection
can progress to AIDS, but the right treatment and certain precautions
can prevent this from happening. HIV testing is an effective way to
diagnose early and prevent progression to AIDS. In this project, we want
to see whether there is a relationship or correlation between the number
of diagnosis of HIV and the number of HIV testing location within NYC.

## The intended final products

A website with interactive graphs and charts that clearly show the
potential correlation among different factors involved in the HIV
diagnosis, including demographic and geographic data. We also want to
include some educational materials relates to our project.

## The anticipated data sources

HIV/AIDS Diagnoses by Neighborhood, Sex, and Race/Ethnicity
(<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/HIV-AIDS-Diagnoses-by-Neighborhood-Sex-and-Race-Et/ykvb-493p>)

HIV Testing Locations
(<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/HIV-Testing-Locations/72ss-25qh>)

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

HIV/AIDS diagnosis distribution by neighborhood, age, race (scatter
chart)

Yearly trend distribution (line chart)

Neighborhood distribution compared to HIV testing location distribution
(visualization TBD)
